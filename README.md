Sales trends analysis for e-commerce company

# Overview
Created in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that provides popular electronic products to global customers. In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset investigating trends in sales, average order value, products, and operational effectiveness to provide insights on Elist's performance across many different areas of the business. I also analyzed the performance of Elist's loyalty program. I provide recommendations based on these insights on where Elist should focus efforts to improve growth.

I used a combination of conditional formatting, aggregation functions, Pivot Tables, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize these insights to deliver to the marketing, finance, operations, and product teams.

# Deep-Dive Insights
**What were the overall trends?**
* **Yearly Summary:** From 2019 to 2022, average number of sales per year was 27k, with average yearly sale revenue of $7M and average order value (AOV) of $254. 2021 saw the highest number of sales (36K), but 2020 had on average the most expensive (AOV of $300).
* **Growth rates:** 2020 had by far the highest growth rate, with more than double the number of sales and the total sales revenue than 2019. On average, 2020 sales were also 31% more expensive than 2019 sales. While 2021 exhibited positive growth in the number of sales, total sales revenue went down, as people purchased items that were on average of 15% less expensive than in 2021.

**Should we keep using the loyalty program?**
* **Findings:** During the 2019 and 2020, loyalty program customers made fewer purchases than non-loyalty program customers, and their purchases were less expensive than non-loyalty customers. However, in more recent years (2021-2022), loyalty customers not only made more purchases than non-loyalty customers, but also purchased about $30 more on average in 2022.
* **Recommendation:** Considering the fact that in recent years, loyalty customers are not only making more purchases but also more expensive purchases than non-loyalty customers, we would recommend continuing with the loyalty program.
